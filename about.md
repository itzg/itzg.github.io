I am software developer and this is my brain dump...well a very small part of it.

Other than the articles you'll see popping up at this site, you can peruse
[my entire set of bookmarks at Diigo](https://www.diigo.com/user/itzgeoff).

* I tend to write code in [Java](https://www.java.com)

* I build full-stack applications with
[Spring](https://spring.io/) and [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).

* I include as much [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) in my diet as possible

* I have [numerous Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/u/itzg/) that you can `docker pull` right now

* I like to play [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) with my kids

* I have [a Docker image for that](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-server/)

* I have developed a webapp called [MCCY](https://mccy.itzg.me/) that combines all of the above
into a Minecraft Server-as-a-Service. [Check out the source too.](https://github.com/moorkop/mccy-engine)
_(It's currently in early development, so just log in using mccy/testing)_
