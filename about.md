I am software developer and this is my brain dump...well a very small part of it.

Other than the articles you'll see popping up at this site, you can peruse [my entire set of bookmarks at Diigo](https://www.diigo.com/user/itzgeoff). I also post articles at [Medium](https://medium.com/@itzgeoff).

* I tend to write code in [Java](https://www.java.com)

* I build full-stack applications with [Spring](https://spring.io/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

* [kidsbank](https://kidsbank.online/) was built with that combo

* I include as much [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) in my diet as possible

* I have [numerous Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/u/itzg/) that you can `docker pull` right now

* I like to play [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) with my kids

* I have [a Docker image for that](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-server/) and [a Bedrock edition](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-bedrock-server)
